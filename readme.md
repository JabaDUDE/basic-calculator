## My Process

I wasn't sure how to approach this project. I know how I wanted to set up the HTML and wanted to play around with the CSS with Bootstrap; however the JS was a challenge to figure
out. So for this project, I loosely followed along with a tutorial. I regret that decision. For their JS, they used eval() function when doing calculations, which MDN recommends
NOT doing. For the time being, I went with it although I fully intend to revisit and redo the javascript in the near future. Outside of this, I am quite pleased with how it looks
and will build upon it and make it more responsive, as well, in the near future. This project was also a great practice is using HTML's table and getting more hands on practice
with it.

### Built With

- Bootstrap
- Javascipt
- Flexbox

### Continued Development

I will expand upon and improve the Javascript and remove the 'eval' in the near future as well as improve the responsiveness for the calculator.
